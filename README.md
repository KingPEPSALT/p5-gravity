# p5-gravity
A gravity sandbox made in p5.js

## Explanation
Although I'm not too sure of the orthodox and expected when working with physics along computers, I did manage to create this using the little knowledge I have. Just with these few equations (if the image does not appear, the LaTex will so you can see these for yourself):
![$ F = ma $](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%20%3D%20ma)
![$ F = G\frac{m_xm_y}{r} $](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?F%20%3D%20G%5Cfrac%7Bm_xm_y%7D%7Br%7D)
![$ a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} $](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a%20%3D%20%5Cfrac%7B%5CDelta%20v%7D%7B%5CDelta%20t%7D)

These were then used to create a final equation where â–³v is only the magnitude of the velocity vector because acceleration in F=ma is not a vector. The vector however is simply the distance between the two bodies normalised.
![$\Delta V_x=\left[\Delta t\frac{G\frac{m_xm_y}{r}}{m_x}\right]\hat r$](https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5CDelta%20V_x%3D%5Cleft%5B%5CDelta%20t%5Cfrac%7BG%5Cfrac%7Bm_xm_y%7D%7Br%7D%7D%7Bm_x%7D%5Cright%5D%5Chat%20r)
This can simply be added onto the velocity of any of the bodies and the resulting velocity vector will be formed.

## TODO
- Standardise units somehow; stop using pixels in the equations unless you use that everywhere
- Allow for user interaction; slinging bodies with the mouse to create an interactive effect
- Allow for user to change time and zoom; interactivity is the best.
